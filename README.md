## ✨ Features

- 🏷️ Create virtual batteries with custom names
- ⏱️ Configure discharge periods (1 day or more)
- 🔄 Reset battery level to 100%
- 🎚️ Set custom battery levels
- 🔧 Modify discharge periods
- 📊 Track battery level over time
- 🖥️ UI-based configuration
- 📦 HACS installation support
- 🔘 Device with reset button for each battery
- 🔗 **Attach to existing devices** - Add battery tracking to devices that don't natively report battery status

## 📥 Installation

### HACS Installation

1. Add this repository as a custom repository in HACS
2. Search for "Virtual Battery" in HACS and install it
3. Restart Home Assistant

### Manual Installation

1. Download the latest release
2. Extract the folder `virtual_battery` from the archive to: `<your-home-assistant-path>/config/custom_components/`
3. Restart Home Assistant

## ⚙️ Configuration

Configure the integration through the UI:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services**
2. Click **+ Add Integration**
3. Search for **Virtual Battery**
4. Follow the configuration steps:
   - **Battery Name**: A unique name for your virtual battery
   - **Discharge Period**: Number of days for the battery to fully discharge
   - **Attach to Device** (optional): Select an existing device to add the battery entities to

### Attaching to Existing Devices

You can optionally attach the virtual battery entities to an existing device in Home Assistant. This is useful for:

- Adding battery tracking to devices that don't natively report battery status
- Keeping all related entities grouped under one device
- Maintaining a cleaner device list

If you leave the device selector empty, a new standalone "Virtual Battery" device will be created (default behavior).

**Important Limitations:**

- Device assignment can **only be set during initial creation** and cannot be changed later through the options flow
- If you need to change the device assignment, you must delete the virtual battery integration and recreate it with the new device selection
- If the target device is later removed from Home Assistant, the virtual battery entities will automatically fall back to a standalone device on the next restart

## 💡 Example Use Cases

Virtual Battery is useful for devices that do not natively report battery status but require regular replacement or recharging. Some example scenarios:

- **Smoke Detectors:** Track battery replacement intervals for detectors that lack smart battery reporting.
- **Remote Controls:** Set up reminders to replace or recharge batteries in remotes that aren't integrated with Home Assistant.
- **Key Finders/Trackers:** Monitor battery change intervals for Bluetooth trackers or key finders.

By configuring a virtual battery with an appropriate discharge period, you can automate reminders and maintenance tasks for any device that needs regular attention.

## 🧰 Usage

After configuration, you'll have a virtual battery device with two entities:

1. A sensor showing the battery level that will automatically discharge over the configured time period
2. A button that can be pressed to reset the battery level to 100%
